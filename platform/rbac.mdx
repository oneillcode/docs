## Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

Control who can access and modify your applications and data.

## User Roles

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Admin" icon="user-tie">
    Full access to all features and settings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Developer" icon="code">
    Build and deploy applications
  </Card>
  <Card title="Viewer" icon="eye">
    View applications only
  </Card>
  <Card title="Custom" icon="sliders">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Permissions

Configure fine-grained permissions for:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Applications" icon="window-restore">
    - Create applications - Edit applications - Delete applications - Deploy
    applications
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Data Sources" icon="database">
    - Add connections - Edit connections - View connection details - Execute
    queries
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Users" icon="users">
    - Invite users - Manage roles - Remove users - View audit logs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Groups

Organize users into groups for easier management:

```javascript
// Example: Assign permissions to a group
const engineeringGroup = {
  name: "Engineering",
  permissions: [
    "applications.create",
    "applications.edit",
    "applications.deploy",
  ],
  members: ["user1@company.com", "user2@company.com"],
};
```

## Audit Logs

Track all access and changes:

- Who accessed what
- When changes were made
- What was modified
- IP addresses and locations
